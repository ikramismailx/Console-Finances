# Console-Finances
This webpage showcases my skills utilising JavaScript in order to provide a simple financial analysis based on a dataset of monthly profits and losses. The dataset, named finances, is an array of arrays containing the month-year and corresponding profit/loss values. You can access the live website [here.](https://ikramismailx.github.io/Console-Finances/)

# Features
The script performs the following financial analysis:
- Total Months: Calculates and logs the total number of months in the dataset.

- Total Profit: Calculates and logs the total profit over the entire period. The script iterates through each entry in the dataset, summing up the profit/loss values.
  
- Average Change: Calculates and logs the average change in profits/losses over the entire period. It computes the difference between consecutive months' profit/loss values and calculates the average of these differences.
  
- Greatest Increase in Profits/Losses: Identifies and logs the month with the greatest increase in profits, along with the corresponding increase amount. The script compares the difference between consecutive months and tracks the month with the maximum increase.
  
- Greatest Decrease in Profits/Losses: Identifies and logs the month with the greatest decrease in profits, along with the corresponding decrease amount. Similar to the increase calculation, the script tracks the month with the maximum decrease.
